# CRLayers Extras

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that makes Conquest Reforged layer blocks behave like their vanilla counterparts.

## Features

This mod adds natural mechanics to Conquest Reforged layer blocks:

### 1. Grass Spreading
- `conquest:grass_block_layer` now spreads to `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab` blocks
- `minecraft:grass_block` also spreads to nearby `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab` blocks
- Mimics vanilla `minecraft:grass_block` spreading to `minecraft:dirt`
- Requires proper light levels (light level 9+ at source, 4+ at target)

### 2. Mycelium Spreading
- `conquest:mycelium_layer` now spreads to `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab` blocks
- Mimics vanilla `minecraft:mycelium` spreading to `minecraft:dirt`
- Can spread in any light level (just like vanilla mycelium)

### 3. Sheep Grass Eating
- Sheep can now eat `conquest:grass_block_layer` blocks
- Converts them to `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab` (similar to vanilla grass → dirt conversion)
- Sheep will regrow their wool after eating, just like in vanilla

### 4. Prevent Grass Block Decay
- Prevents `minecraft:grass_block` from turning into dirt when covered by a block (light level 0)
- Useful for building with grass blocks underground or under structures

## Configuration

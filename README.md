# Arona Layers Extras

A Fabric mod that makes layer blocks from **Conquest Reforged** and **VanillaLayer+** behave like their vanilla counterparts — grass spreads onto them, sheep eat them, they fall with sand, and plants sit flush on top of them.

Supports **Minecraft 1.20.1, 1.21.1, 1.21.11, 26.1.2 and 26.2** from a single shared codebase.

## Overview

Layer blocks are sub-block-height blocks used to smooth out terrain. Out of the box the game treats them as inert decoration: grass will not spread onto them, sheep ignore them, sand falls straight past them, and plants placed on top float in mid-air.

This mod closes those gaps. It needs a **layer block provider** to be useful:

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Conquest Reforged** | `grass_block_layer`, `loamy_dirt_slab`, `mycelium_layer` and the rest of the CR layer set |
| **VanillaLayer+** | `grass_layer`, `dirt_layer`, `mycelium_layer` |

Both can be installed at once — each feature activates only for the blocks it finds. With neither installed the mod loads and does nothing harmful; the plant visual offset still works on vanilla partial-height blocks such as snow layers.

## Features

### 1. Grass Spreading
- `conquest:grass_block_layer` spreads to `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab`
- `vanillalayerplus:grass_layer` spreads to `vanillalayerplus:dirt_layer`
- `minecraft:grass_block` also spreads to both of the above
- Requires proper light levels (light level 9+ at source, 4+ at target)

### 2. Mycelium Spreading
- `conquest:mycelium_layer` spreads to `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab`
- `vanillalayerplus:mycelium_layer` spreads to `vanillalayerplus:dirt_layer`
- Mimics vanilla mycelium — can spread at any light level

### 3. Sheep Grass Eating
- Sheep can eat `conquest:grass_block_layer` (converts to `conquest:loamy_dirt_slab`)
- Sheep can eat `vanillalayerplus:grass_layer` (converts to `vanillalayerplus:dirt_layer`)
- Sheep regrow wool after eating, just like in vanilla

### 4. Prevent Grass Block Decay
- Prevents `minecraft:grass_block` from turning into dirt when covered (light level 0)
- Useful for building with grass blocks underground or under structures

### 5. Layer Blocks Fall with Sand/Gravel
- When sand or gravel falls, CR and VanillaLayer+ layer/slab blocks directly above also fall
- Cascades upward through multiple stacked layer blocks
- Applies to `minecraft:sand`, `minecraft:red_sand`, and `minecraft:gravel`
- Also triggers when a player breaks sand/gravel directly (layers above fall immediately)

### 6. Plant Visual Offset on Layer Blocks
- Plants and flowers placed on partial-height layer blocks are shifted downward visually to sit flush with the layer surface
- Works for tall plants too (both lower and upper half are offset correctly)
- Applies to vanilla plants by default (flowers, tall grass, saplings, mushrooms, etc.)
- Extra plants from other mods (e.g. `conquest:seagrass`) can be added via the config
- Purely visual — it does not change collision, placement rules or what the server thinks is there

> **1.21.11 and newer pick plants by block type** (anything extending `VegetationBlock`), so plants added by newer Minecraft versions — `bush`, `firefly_bush`, `leaf_litter`, `wildflowers`, `short_dry_grass`, `cactus_flower` and so on — are handled automatically. 1.20.1 and 1.21.1 use a fixed list of the plants that exist on those versions. `AdditionalOffsetBlocks` works the same way on all five.

## Requirements

| Minecraft | Fabric Loader | Fabric API | Java |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------|
| 1.20.1 | 0.15.0+ | 0.92.2+ | 17 |
| 1.21.1 | 0.16.0+ | 0.104.0+ | 21 |
| 1.21.11 | 0.19.0+ | 0.141.5+ | 21 |
| 26.1.2 | 0.19.0+ | 0.154.2+ | 25 |
| 26.2 | 0.19.0+ | 0.156.0+ | 25 |

The plant visual offset is drawn through the Fabric Rendering API, so a provider for that API is required:

| Minecraft | Renderer requirement |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 1.20.1 | [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) — Sodium is still 0.5.x here, which does not implement the Fabric Rendering API |
| 1.21.1, 1.21.11, 26.1.2, 26.2 | [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) 0.6.0+ — it implements the API natively |

> **Do not install Indium on 1.21.1 or newer.** It is unnecessary there and is not compatible with Sodium 0.6.0+.

Plus a layer block provider:

- [Conquest Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/conquest-reforged)
- VanillaLayer+

> Availability differs per Minecraft version. Conquest Reforged and VanillaLayer+ do not exist on every supported version — check before planning a setup. Without a provider the layer features simply stay inactive; nothing breaks.

### Optional

- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) — in-game config screen
- [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) — required by the config screen

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader and Fabric API for your Minecraft version (see the table above)
2. Install the renderer requirement for your version — Indium on 1.20.1, Sodium 0.6.0+ on 1.21.1 and newer
3. Install Conquest Reforged and/or VanillaLayer+
4. Place the mod JAR **for your Minecraft version** in your mods folder
5. Launch once to generate `config/aronalayersextras.json`

## Configuration

All features can be toggled individually. The config file is `config/aronalayersextras.json`, created automatically on first launch.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enableGrassSpreading` | `true` | Grass spreads to CR/VLP dirt layer equivalents |
| `enableMyceliumSpreading` | `true` | Mycelium spreads to CR/VLP dirt layer equivalents |
| `enableSheepEatingGrassLayers` | `true` | Sheep can eat CR/VLP grass layer blocks |
| `preventGrassDecay` | `true` | Grass blocks never decay to dirt in darkness |
| `enableLayersFallWithSand` | `true` | CR/VLP layer blocks fall when sand/gravel falls or is broken |
| `enableBlockOffset` | `true` | Plants are visually shifted down on partial-height layer blocks |
| `VanillaBlockOffset` | `true` | Vanilla plants receive the visual offset. Set to `false` to restrict the offset to `AdditionalOffsetBlocks` only. **Requires F3+T to take effect.** |
| `AdditionalOffsetBlocks` | `["conquest:seagrass", "conquest:tall_seagrass", "minecraft:pink_petals"]` | Extra plant block IDs from other mods that also receive the visual offset. **Requires F3+T to take effect.** |

### Mod Menu Support

With [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) installed, most settings can be changed in-game through the Mod Menu config screen. Changes take effect immediately without restarting — except `VanillaBlockOffset` and `AdditionalOffsetBlocks`, which are applied at model bake time and need a resource reload (F3+T).

## Building from Source

```
./gradlew build
```

Each Minecraft version is a Gradle subproject sharing one source tree (`src/`), with version-specific code in the subproject's own `src/`. JARs land in each subproject's `build/libs/`:

```
v1_20_1/build/libs/    v1_21_1/build/libs/    v1_21_11/build/libs/
v26_1_2/build/libs/    v26_2/build/libs/
```

Build a single version with `./gradlew :v1_21_1:build`.

> Changing `fabric_version` in a subproject also needs `.gradle/loom-cache/minecraftMaven/**/<mc-version>/` deleted. Loom bakes Fabric's injected interfaces into the cached Minecraft jar and does not rebuild it when only the API version changes, so the jar keeps interfaces from the old Fabric API. Nothing warns: you get `cannot access <SomeInterface>` on an unrelated line — `sheep.level()`, say — because javac cannot complete the class hierarchy.

> If the repository sits in a synced folder such as OneDrive, `build/` can get file-locked — Gradle then reports `Unable to delete directory` or `Failed to clean up stale outputs`, and in the worst case `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` while leaving the *previous* JAR in place. Build with `-PbuildDirRoot=<path>` (or set `ARONALAYERS_BUILD_DIR`) to move outputs elsewhere, or check the JAR timestamp before trusting a test.

`scripts/verify_mixins.py` checks that every mixin in a built JAR resolves against its Minecraft version:

```
python scripts/verify_mixins.py v1_20_1 v1_21_1 v1_21_11 v26_1_2 v26_2
```

Worth running before releasing. An unresolvable mixin target still builds successfully and only fails when the game loads — and on the 26.x versions, which ship deobfuscated, nothing is remapped, so the build cannot warn about it at all.

`scripts/mapping-tools/` holds the one-off scripts used to port across Minecraft versions — deriving renames by joining mapping sets through intermediary rather than guessing them one compiler error at a time. See its [README](scripts/mapping-tools/README.md).

## A note on how this fork is developed

I use Claude AI as a development aid, mainly for the repetitive parts of multi-version maintenance, tracking down what a renamed Minecraft API became, debugging, etc.

That is where the help stops. I decide what goes in, I read the changes, and I test in-game before releasing. Fixes get re-tested after the fact, not assumed.

I am saying this because "AI-assisted" often means code nobody checked. That is not what this is. If you find a bug anyway, please open an issue — I would rather hear about it.
